### Language Knowledge

You should have a basic afinity with the language that you are writing your tests in.

These workshops focus on the TDD aspect of the development and so we are not using complex objects, patterns or DI.

## Workshops

We have three workshops at present:

* [Getting started](./workshops/workshop-1.md)
* [Complex objects](./workshops/workshop-2.md)
* [Complex objects - writing your own test code](./workshops/workshop-3.md)
* [Complex objects - writing your own test suite](./workshops/workshop-4.md)
* [Changing existing code](.workshops/workshop-5.md)

As with the language support, if you would like to add a workshop please send us a PR!
