# tdd-workshop
A set of TDD workshops, from into to complex to help you get started using this tool!

## Lanuages

Currently our workshops are available in C# and JS.

If you would like to add a language here, please sub mit a PR - we'd love to have you on board!


## Workshops

As with the language support, if you would like to add a workshop please send us a PR!

### Your first TDD - FizzBuzz

We are going to build FizzBuzz, and get you started on your test first journey at the same time.

To make things a little easier for you, we've written the tests already! You can concentrate on just getting the code running.

Rules:

Each test is it's own part of the workshop. If you are staying focused, and only implmenting what you need for the test, then you should be able to make each test green before moving to the next.

If you do make multiple tests go from red to green in one change then see if you can undo it and make a smaller change!

(And, of course, if a test is green it should stay green!)

Don't worry about refactoring, and making your code pretty until all your tests are green - concentrate on gettings those tests passing first!)

### Step it up a gear - Object mapping!

After getting your first taste on FizzBuzz lets do something a little more real world for you - an object mapper.

Again, we have made the tests for you, you just need to implemented code code to make those tests pass.

There are some helper functions properties given to you to help you mock the data, and for reference an entire API response so that you can see the structure of the data.

### A little more tricky - <think of example>
  
  If you've done the first two challanges then you are ready to take your next step.
  
  We are going to <sometomg> for you, and we have given you tests, but they are a little empty. In fact... They all just assert fale is true.
  
  You need to look at the description of the test, write the test, and then write the code in order to make it pass! Good luck!
