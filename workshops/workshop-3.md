# Write your own tests - Object Mapping
  
In the first two challenges you've created a simple FizzBuzz function, and written an app to extract data from an API JSON.

For both of these the focus was on the writing of code to make tests pass, and to make the tests pass in the right order!

Seeing we completed those steps it's time to make it a little harder!

We are extracting data from another API here, previously we had our list of summary information from our data source for blog posts, here we are fetching the blog posts itself.

If you look in the solution you will see that there is still a model for you to use, a function and test file. But that function and test file are a little empty and currently return exceptions and asset that `false == true`

You need to flesh out the tests to do what the description says before implementing the code to make that test pass.

Our helper functions have also dissapeared - these you will need to make yourself - if you decide you want/need them.

A big challange here is to first make sure that you test fails. Not with the `false == true` asertion, but with actual test code.

Finally... Remember to ensure that you are only making one test pass at a time! When writing your own tests it's easy to get caught up in the moment and go too quickly. Good luck!
