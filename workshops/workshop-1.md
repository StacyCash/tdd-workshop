# Your first TDD - FizzBuzz

We are starting with FizzBuzz - this is a simple puzzle with 4 rules:

* If a number is divisible by 3 return 'Fizz'
* If a number is divisible by 5 return 'Buzz'
* If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5 return 'FizzBuzz'
* Otherwise return the number as string

To help you on your journey this workshop includes all tests, and the empty function.

You task is to make each of the tests go green in turn.

> Remember: We want to write the simplest code for each test. Your code should not make more than one test go green for each change that you do. If multiple tests go from red to green with one code change then you've done too much. Undo the change and try again!

Once a test is green it should stay green. If your new code breaks an old test, fix the problem before moving on.

Don't refactor more than you need to ensure that all passing tests remain green whilst working through the workshop. When all tests are green you can do your refactoring to make the code more readable, and know that you have not broken anything because your tests will remain green!
